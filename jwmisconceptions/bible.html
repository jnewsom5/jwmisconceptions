	<h2>Do Jehovah's Witnesses have their own Bible?</h2>
	<p>Throughout our studies we have used many different Bible translations. We do enjoy using the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures for its use of God's name, for its accuracy, and for its clarity.
	</p>

	<p>Many Bible translators have failed to put God's name in the Bible. One Bible translation mentions all the 70 people who contributed in making the translation but no credit was given to the one who inspired the scriptures. That Bible translation omits the name of the original Author-Jehovah God! The New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, produced in hundreds of languages, restores God's name some 7,000 times. And still the translators remain anonymous. Play the video below for more in information about the original Author of the Bible.
	</p>
	<p>Many Bible translations do not convey the message from the Bible accurately. For example, one translation Matthew 7:13 says: “Go in through the narrow gate, because the gate to hell is wide and the road that leads to it is easy.” However, the original text used "destruction", not "hell". Some translators insert the word "hell" to support their belief that wicked people will be tormented forever in hellfire. 
	<a href"https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/matthew/7/">(Matthew 7:13)
	</a>
	accurately conveys in the New World Translation: “Go in through the narrow gate, because broad is the gate and spacious is the road leading off into destruction.” 
	</p>
	<p>A good translation of the Bible should not only be accurate but also clear and easy to understand. There are many instances in the Bible that the original text makes little sense in the terms of today. For example, at <a href"https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/romans/12/">(Romans 12:11)
	</a>, the apostle Paul used an expression that literally means "to spirit boiling." In modern English that really does not make much sense. The New World Translation conveys this scripture in a way we can all understand. It says that Christians should be "aglow in spirit".
	</p>
	<p> In addition to its use of God's name, accuracy and clarity, the New World Translation is distriubted free of charge, so millions are able to read the Bible in the language of their heart even if you do not have the money to afford a Bible.
