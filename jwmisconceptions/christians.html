	<h2>Are Jehovah's Witnesses Christians?</h2>
	<img src="images/studybible.jpg" alt="biblestudy" class="center" style="width:700px;">
	<p>Yes, Jehovah Witnesses are Christians. How?
		<ul>
			<li>We try to imitate Jesus teachings and his way of life very closely. He left a model for us to follow <a href"https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/1peter/2/"> —1Peter 2:21</a>.</li>
			<li>We believe that Jesus is the only way to salvation, “there is not another name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must get saved.”<a href"https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/acts/4/"> —Acts 4:12</a>.
			</li>
			<li>When ones become Jehovah's Witnesses, they are baptized in the name of Jesus. We offer prayers in Jesus name <a href"https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/Matthew/28/"> —Matthew 28:18, 19</a> <a href"https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/john/15/"> ,John 15:16</a>
			</li>
			<li>We are different from many religious organizations that are called Christian. For example, we believe that Jesus is God's son, not part of a Trinity. We do not believe that there is any evidence in the Bible that supports the teaching of wicked people being tormented in hell or religious leaders having a higher title or ranking in their religious activities. See video below for more information on our belief of Jesus being God's son.
			</li>
